# LaunchDarkly Client-Side SDK for .NET

For first time users, visit our [LaunchDarkly Docs](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/client-side/dotnet) page.  Within these docs, the [LDClient](api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.Client.LdClient.html) and the [ContextBuilder](api/LaunchDarkly.Sdk.ContextBuilder.html) are good starting points to explore from.

This site contains the full API reference for the [`LaunchDarkly.ClientSdk`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LaunchDarkly.ClientSdk) package, as well other packages used by the client package.

For source code, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-client-sdk). The [developer notes](https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-client-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) there include links to other repositories used in the SDK.
