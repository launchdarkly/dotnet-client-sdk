Supported platforms
-------------------

This beta release is built for the following targets: Android 7.1, 8.0, 8.1; iOS 10; .NET Standard 1.6, 2.0. It has also been tested with Android 9/API 28 and iOS 12.1.

Note that if you are targeting .NET Framework, there is a [known issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46788323/installing-a-netstandard-2-0-nuget-package-into-a-vs2015-net-4-6-1-project) in Visual Studio 2015 where it does not correctly detect compatibility with .NET Standard packages. This is not a problem in later versions of Visual Studio.

Getting started
-----------

Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/client-side/xamarin#getting-started) for instructions on getting started with using the SDK.

Learn more
-----------

Check out our [documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for this SDK](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/xamarin-sdk-reference) or our [code-generated API documentation](https://launchdarkly.github.io/xamarin-client-sdk/).

Testing
-------

We run integration tests for all our SDKs using a centralized test harness. This approach gives us the ability to test for consistency across SDKs, as well as test networking behavior in a long-running application. These tests cover each method in the SDK, and verify that event sending, flag evaluation, stream reconnection, and other aspects of the SDK all behave correctly.

Contributing
------------

We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Check out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to this SDK.

About LaunchDarkly
-----------

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
